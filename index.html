                I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honsetly feel I got every penny's worth.

                " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free course
                and found it incredibely fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The
                next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                life. Since completeing the course, I've successfully switched
                careers, working as a software engineer at a VR startup. "

              " Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code.
              I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outsanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my development experience. It certianly helped me land
              a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multipule offers.
              100% recommend! "
